# LED project the first
This is my _first time_ playing with an LED board - and there was _a lot_ of learning involved. 

**The Project** 
Essentially this is a mini fireworks pattern, using 3 different colours. The LEDs eventually all fade to off.
I used an ESP8266-D1 and a 5*8 LED Matrix (Adafruit Neopixel Shield).

**Notes**
It is a fairly janky hand-built pattern, mostly as a proof of concept. 

This was my first time with:
  - Platform IO
  - C++ Language
  - Using a library

I used an excel sheet to help visualise the iterations.
